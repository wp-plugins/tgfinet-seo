Override titles, descriptions and keywords with page/post level input. Designed for use with Wordpress as a CMS with the blog not on the homepage.

== Description ==

Override titles, descriptions and keywords with page/post level input for greater control of **Search Engine Optimization**.

This is a fairly modified version of the [all-in-one-seo-pack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) for the specific situation of using Wordpress as a CMS tool first and a blog second. We fixed some quirky duplication of title and meta info as well.
